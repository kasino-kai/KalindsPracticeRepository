Commit → Push → View on your repo’s **main page** → you should see the flowchart.

### ❌ Where it won’t work
- If you put the same code in **index.html** (for GitHub Pages), it won’t render unless you import the Mermaid.js library manually.  
- If you’re just opening the Markdown locally in a browser, it won’t render unless your editor (like VS Code with a plugin) has Mermaid support.  

---

👉 Quick test for you:  
- Does your **README.md file** in the repo show the diagram correctly on **github.com**?  
  - If yes → your GitHub Markdown is working.  
  - If no → it may be disabled for your org/account, but it’s usually on by default.  

Do you want me to give you the **HTML + JavaScript snippet** that makes Mermaid work on GitHub Pages (so it renders in your `index.html` site too)?
